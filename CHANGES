2.0.5
- Removed support for VS2010.
- Added support for VS2017.
- Modified code to validate the user provided data types in the Table Designer Editor which provides a more user-friendly
  experience. (Bug #13477821 - VISUAL STUDIO TABLE DESIGNER SHOWS BIT TYPE AS BIT(10))
- Fixed a problem which caused the wrong schema to be exported whenever unselecting schemas from the Schema list.
- Fixed bug which caused the currently selected schema's db objects to become unselected in the Tree view after unselecting a
  different schema from the Schema list. (Bug #23666666 - EXPORT TOOL IS EXPORTING THE WRONG SCHEMA)
- The value of multiple properties would be shown as blank in the Advanced Properties dialog whenever creating/editing a
  connection through the Server Explorer. The resulting connection string would contain the correct values, however it was
  misleading not to see them in the Advanced Properties dialog.
- Enabled the SQL Editor to display execution results information in the "MySQL Output" pane.
- Fixed a problem which prevented SQL, JavaScript and Python scripts from detecting keyboard input for keys such as Enter,
  Backspace, Arrows, etc. This would only happen after saving the script for the first time.
  (Bug #24751945 - SCRIPT CAN'T GET EDITED AFTER SAVING IT)
- Fixed a problem with the Field Types view which failed to show any fields whenever the executed statement contained table
  names with a format of "<database_name>.<table_name>" or field names with a format of
  "<database_name>.<table_name>.<field_name>".
  (MySQL Bug #82882, Bug #24601948 - FIELD TYPES NOT WORKING FOR QUERIES WHERE SCHEMA IS SPECIFIED)
- Fixed a problem with the Python Scripts feature in which the execution failed if the line termination sequences included LF
  instead of CRLF. This scenario would occur when copying code from other editors into the Visual Studio editor.
  (MySQL Bug #83854, Bug #25107595 - PYTHON SCRIPT NOT GENERATING OUTPUT IN BATCH MODE)


2.0.4
- Enhanced the logic that migrates stored MySQL connections to the MySQL Workbench connections.xml file. In previous versions
  the migration was offered and if not done at that moment, the dialog to migrate was shown every time the "MySQL Connections
  Manager" dialog was shown, but there was no way to choose to remain storing MySQL connections in the MySQL for Visual Studio
  configuration folder instead of merging them with the Workbench ones. Now the connections migration dialog offers a way to
  postpone the migration 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month or indefinitely. If the migration is postponed the dialog is shown again
  after that time elapses, although if it is postponed indefinitely an option was added to the "MySQL Connections Manager"
  dialog that permits the migration of connections to be done manually, as long as MySQL Workbench is installed.
- Fixed a problem when a new MySQL script editor for SQL is initialized through the creation of a new SQL script file, the
  plugin tried to retrieve some information from a non-existent connection.
  (Bug #23619311 - ERROR GENERATED WHEN MYSQL SCRIPT IS CREATED)
- Fixed code that enables/disables the context menu options for creating a new MySQL Script file by right-clicking a MySQL
  connection in the Server Explorer, depending on the connection status and on the MySQL Server version supporting the MySQL
  X Protocol. (MySQL Bug #82205, Bug #24064816 - ERROR WHEN SELECTING NEW MYSQL SCRIPT CONTEXT-MENU OPTION FROM A CLOSED CONN)
- Fixed the hardcoding of MySQLForExcel in the custom settings provider so its main XML element is named after the Application
  Name ("MySQLForVisualStudio"). Added indentation to inner elements in the configuration file.
  (MySQL Bug #82221, Bug #24291264 - SETTINGS FILE MAIN XML ELEMENT CALLED MYSQLFOREXCEL)
- Added a validation to check if the Server version of an unnamed/temporary connection, created within a MySQL Script editor,
  supports the X Protocol; since JavaScript and Python scripts only work using the X Protocol.
  (MySQL Bug #82219, Bug #24290570 - PYTHON AND JS SCRIPTS NOT VALIDATING X PROTOCOL SUPPORT USING MANUAL CONNECTIONS)
- Added support for "Optimizer Hints", creating Parser unit tests to validate optimizer hints queries and validating such queries
  can be executed in MySQL query editor.
- When the MySQL Script Editor window is opened (either by selecting SQL, JavaScript or Python from the New MySQL Script menu),
  the Results area was visible showing a big gray area in the editor, despite having nothing to display. Now, this area is hidden
  until results are ready to display, which happens after clicking Run.
- Dragging a and dropping a table from Visual Studio's Server Explorer to a project would fail with the following error: "Some
  updating commands could not be generated automatically. The database returned the following error: You have a usable connection
  already". After clicking OK, Visual Studio would emit the following error "Mouse drag operation failed. Could not retrieve
  schema information from table or view". To solve this issue, MySql.Data was updated to version 6.9.9.
- From the Query Designer, selecting Verify SQL Syntax would always display "Not supported by the provider" instead of verifying
  the SQL syntax.
- Enhanced the "Connect to MySQL" dialog shown when establishing a new connection within MySQL script editor windows, to have a
  look and feel consistent with other MySQL for Windows products. The dialog now offers the ability to add the newly created
  connection to the Server Explorer in Visual Studio. The problem with the Advanced button was also fixed.
  (Bug #22114315 - ADVANCED BUTTON IN MYSQL SCRIPT -> CONNECT TO MYSQL CONFIGURATION HIDE BUTTONS)
- Added the ability to fast-switch connections within any of the MySQL script editor windows (SQL, JavaScript or Python), a new
  drop-down is available next to the "Connect to MySQL..." button (first button in the editor window toolbar) that shows all
  Server Explorer connections for the MySQL data provider.
- Changed the way queries are executed in the SQL script editor, so that a problem caused by non-unique data in MySQL Document
  Store tables is not present anymore. (MySQL Bug #82589, Bug #24462707 - SQL EDITOR - ERROR ON SELECT WITH DOC STORE TABLE)
- Added to the SQL editor the ability to check the syntax of a script when it is executed. Before the script's statements are
  actually sent to the server the syntax check is done; if errors are found the script is not actually executed and the errors
  are displayed in Visual Studio's Output pane.
- Fixed the ANTLR grammar for the SHOW statement to allow for SHOW SCHEMAS in the same fashion as SHOW DATABASES works.
  (Bug #24622881 - COMMAND: SHOW SCHEMAS DOES NOTHING ON SQL MODE)
- Improved the way Result objects from the X Protocol are processed to make the processing faster; and if a result is not a
  BaseResult object and is a collection returned as plain text, process it so it is displayed as a collection instead of an error
  or information text message. (Bug #22983803 - JS OUTPUT RESULTS, SHOWS "UNDEFINED" TEXT WHEN COMMAND HAS NOTHING TO DISPLAY)
- Fixed the way the MySQL data provider falls back to the provider shipped with MySQL for Visual Studio when Connector/NET is
  not installed, or the MySQL data provider is not found in the Global Assembly Cache.
  (Bug #23642010 - [SERVER EXPLORER] RIGHT CLICK ANY TABLE AND SELECT DESIGN, IT RAISE AN ERROR)


2.0.3
- Fixed the error being thrown when executing JavaScript queries on MySQL X Protocol connections that involve the use of the
  "mysqlx" module, because the module "mysqlx" for JavaScript cannot be imported. (MySql Bug #81052, Oracle bug #23091964).
- Improved the handling of errors, warnings and execution stats output of MySQL X DevAPI statements, all messages are properly
  handled and displayed after batch or console execution.
- Added a new “MySQL Output” pane to display MySQL X DevAPI execution results information, like execution success and times.
- Added "Console Mode" support for JavaScript and Python script editors.  In this mode query execution mimics the way the
  MySQL Shell works, meaning MySQL X DevAPI statements are executed after hitting <ENTER> and results are displayed inline.
- Added a new “MySQL Connections Manager” that enables the sharing of stored MySQL connections with MySQL Workbench if
  It’s installed. MySQL connections are displayed in a friendly way and can be created and edited from within the 
  “MySQL Connections Manager” dialog, and these can be imported to Visual Studio’s Server Explorer to be used in Visual Studio.
- Added SSL support for MySQL connections that use the MySQL X Protocol. SSL support works with PEM files, so SSL connections
  need to be created through the “MySQL Connections Manager” or MySQL Workbench.  Please refer to the official documentation
  for more information.
- Added support for new MySQL X DevAPI functions: parseUri(), isOpen().


2.0.2
- Fixed the MySQL X Protocol support for all Visual Studio versions supported by MySQL for Visual Studio (2010 and newer).
- Added support for Visual Studio 2015 with .NET Framework 4.6.
- Updated the MySQL parser's grammar to include keywords introduced in MySQL 5.7.


2.0.1
- Added a new Editor to handle MySQL Phyton script files.
- Added a new option to create new MySQL Phyton script directly from Server Explorer.


2.0.0
- Fixed problem with font colors that made them difficult to read when using the Visual Studio's Dark theme.
- Added a new option to create new MySQL scripts directly from Server Explorer.
- Added a new Editor to handle Javascript files.
- Added a new option to create new MyJs scripts directly from Server Explorer.
- Move info messages from "Messages" Tab in the current Query Editor to the VS output Window.
- Added a Workbench-like vertical menu to the current Query Editor which will be shown with script results to switch between 
  the following views: Result Set, Field Types, Query Stats and Execution Plan.
- Added new information panes to the current Query Editor that are going to be displayed in the result set area: 
  Field Types, Query Stats and Execution Plan.
- Added the support to handle multiple result sets in the current Query Editor.
- Fix controls color to match default provided VS Themes (Dark, Blue and Light).
- Support added for MySQL X Protocol, included in MySQL Server 5.7.9.


1.2.6

- Fix a bug which prevent users to create a non MySql connection in the Server Explorer pane in VisualStudio 
  after the user create a MySql Connection checking the option "Always use this selection" when selecting 
  the Data Source and Data Provider (MySql Bug #77441, Oracle bug #22122881)
- Fixed the bug that was preventing to "Generate Database from Model" in an existing "edmx" model,
  caused by an invalid path to the Connector/NET assembly in the MySQL T4 templates files 
  (MySql Bug #74388, Oracle bug #20234532).
- Fixed the error being thrown when working with an empty "edmx" model and attempt to generate a database
  from model, due an invalid data in the MySQL "ttinclude" file (Oracle bug #18181649).
- Create a powershell scripts to handle the uninstall/upgrade issue present in any M4VS plugin versions 
  prior to 1.2.5, when having installed VS2012, or VS2013 or VS2015 and the M4VS plugin < 1.2.5, and then
  uninstall VS first, so when trying to uninstall the M4VS the uninstall/upgrade process was being rolled-back.
- Fixed the M4VS plugin version shown in the "Extensions and Updates" Visual Studio menu to reflect the latest
  released version (Oracle bug #22114385).


1.2.5
- Fixed the bug where the "MySQL Workbench" and "MySQL Utilities" buttons were disabled (Oracle Bug #21495692).
- Fixed the bug with the M4VS installer where having any plugin version installed on any Visual Studio
  version, and then uninstall Visual Studio first, the M4VS plugin couldn't be uninstalled or upgraded
  (MySQL Bug #71226, Oracle Bug #21953055).
- Remove the "Project Templates" option from the plugin toolbar button and from the "File -> New -> Project" menu, 
  in order to add the "Item Templates" feature with two options: MySQL MVC Item and MySQL Windows Forms Item, 
  available as a context menu for existing projects, which will add a new windows forms or MVC controllers/views 
  connected to MySQL. There is a known issue with item templates not working correctly with MySQL Server 5.7.x,
  avoiding the user to create the entity framework model.
- Added the "Entity Framework" option to the MySQL Website Configuration Dialog, for web projects, so Entity Framework
  version 5 or 6 can be used with a MySQL database provider, automatically adding the configuration/references needed
  to the web.config file and the project itself.
- Fixed the bug where the dataset designer wizard was not showing the stored procedure parameters when creating a 
  "TableAdapter" using existing stored procedures for the "Select" command. Also, fixed the bug where the stored procedure
  command having an "error" command was avoiding the dataset to be created (MySQL Bug #74195, Oracle Bug #20233133).
